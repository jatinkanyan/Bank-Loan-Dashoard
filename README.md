# Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This dashboard provides a comprehensive 360-degree view of the bank’s loan portfolio, enabling stakeholders to monitor lending performance and financial stability in real-time. By aggregating key metrics like **Total Funded Amount**, **MTD (Month-to-Date) Applications**, and **Average Interest Rates**, it offers a strategic snapshot of capital deployment.

The summary highlights the balance between **'Good' and 'Bad' loans**, allowing for immediate assessment of credit risk and net interest margins to ensure long-term portfolio sustainability.
